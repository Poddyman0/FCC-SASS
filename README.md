<p><strong>Mastering Sass for Enhanced CSS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I delved into Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets), a powerful CSS extension that enhances the capabilities of traditional CSS. Sass introduces advanced features that simplify and streamline the process of writing and maintaining stylesheets.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sass:</strong> A CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with variables, nesting, mixins, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> The standard language for styling web pages, which is compiled from Sass.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Variables:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Stored values such as colors, fonts, and spacing in variables to promote consistency and ease of updates across the stylesheet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Nesting:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized nesting to organize CSS rules hierarchically, making the stylesheet more readable and mirroring the HTML structure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mixins:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Created reusable style blocks with mixins, allowing for code reuse and simplifying complex style definitions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Partials and Imports:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Organized CSS into smaller, modular files using partials and imported them into a main stylesheet, improving maintainability and structure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Inheritance with Extend:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used Sassâ€™s <code>@extend</code> feature to share styles between selectors, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Loops and Logic:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporated loops and conditional statements to dynamically generate CSS rules, handling repetitive patterns efficiently.
